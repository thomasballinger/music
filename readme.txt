boston hack day 2011

I think I'm going with lolcats


Original Idea by Adam Lindsay:
"""
Dear #musichackday. You're welcome.
I don't have the time to participate directly in the Boston Music Hack Day coming up this weekend, but one thing I might do with a spare hour or two would be to use:

Echonest's image search by artist.
Lyricfind's API.
A LOLSpeak translation dictionary.
The Cheezburger network's content caption API.

Hilarity would inevitably follow.
"""

Hm - graphing echonest data would also be fun - band name correlates with popularity  

Also the bluenote stuff is pretty awesome content - anything that fits that well?
